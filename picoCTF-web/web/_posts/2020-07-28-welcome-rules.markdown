Welcome to the Cybercore CTF game!

We hope you have fun playing the CTF game. The game consists of a series of questions, each with a statement so solve to get the flag. The flag is submitted through the website and you will be rewarded points if you get it right!

A couple of things to note and rules about the CTF:
 * Do NOT hack the CTF server! (no nmap scans & etc.)
 * You may connect to and hack the links and files that are given to you.
 * The most common credentials are `admin` and `password` for the problems. Not all problems use this terribly common logon.
 * Focus on challenges you are best at. Don't stay on a stuck on single problem for a really long time as there are many easy ones to solve first for points. Come back to the harder ones later.
 * Some problems have a `flag{answer}` wrapper around the answer value to help indicate what the answer.
 * You can include `picoCTF{answer}` or `flag{answer}` wrapper around the answer or just type in the `answer` directly in the submission box.
 * Most problems are all lower case unless the flag naturally contains upper case characters or is specified in the problem.
 * Try not to add formatting to the answer. If you calculate the answer to be `12345`, submit `12345`, not `12,345`. This also applies to text with misspelled words or missing punctuation.
 * If you think you have the right flag answer and it isn't being accepted. You can ask one of the interns to check it. We can help with formatting errors.
 * We can not give out answers, clarifications and maybe hints on problems if it is deemed confusing by the interns or teachers.
 * Submitting too many answers in short amount of time can result in a rate limit error. There is no penalty for hitting the rate limiter but you will have to wait until it accepts a new submitted answer.
 * There are hints on most problems, use them. They do not cost any points.


Good luck and have fun!
