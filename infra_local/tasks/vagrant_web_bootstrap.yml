# A collection of tasks that are suitable to bootstrap a web host in a vagrant
# environment. Performs the following key functions (many of which require that
# the shell server has been properly provisioned first):
#
# 1. Adds a pre-generated SSH key that is authorized on the shell server
# 2. Adds any user requested administrative keys
# 3. Configures docker client certificates


# 1. This key is generated in the vagrant_shell_bootstrap.yml playbook and is
# necessary to allow the web server to SSH to the shell server in order to
# "load deployment" and fetch the deployed challenges.
